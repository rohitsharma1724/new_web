                <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks,
                    the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal
                    implications.
                    My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
                    Foundation
                    Fellowship.</p>
